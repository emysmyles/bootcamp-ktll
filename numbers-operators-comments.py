"""
This is for a block level comment
Block level means multiple lines 
So with this type of comment i can write a paragraph on multiple lines

It is very common in python to use block level comments for documentation purpose
Usually this is done when writing a function or a class in python
It can also be used to document a whole script
"""
# Below we use single quotes for another block level comment
'''
This is another block level comment
But this one is using a single quote
Note that you must be consistent with the type of quotes you are using

############## OPERATORS ##############

# OPERATORS
operators are simply signs that tell the computer what to do
There are few categories
1. Mathematical operators
These are simly the signs we use in mathematics
Examples include:
 " + " :for addition
 " - " :for subtraction
 " / " :for division
 " * " :for multiplication
 " % " called modulo. It is used to get the remainder of a division operation
 " // " called integer division. Used only to get the whole number part of a division
 " ** " :for raising a number to a power

2. Logical operators
These are used for comparison
Examples include:
" > " : greater than
" < " : less than
" = " : checking for equality
"!=" : checking non equality
"""
print('addition', 2+4) #this is addition
print('subtraction',4-4) #this is subtraction
print('division',4/2) #this is division
print('multiplication',3*2) #this is multiplication
print('modulo division',6%4) #this will give only the remainder of the division
print('integer division',6//4) #this will give only the whole number part of the division
print('raise to a power',2**3) #this is raising a number to a power
print('modulo division',4%4) 

print(2>4) #this is for greater than
print(2<4) #this is for less than
print(2==4) #checking for equality
print(2!=4) #checking non equality
